//! The thread that hosts the core: the tick loop + the job queue (D-032,
//! D-033).
//!
//! **The shell only drives the loop.** Advancing, writing listens and
//! producing the report happen inside `LiveSession::tick()` — the same call
//! as the TUI; the same dance is not written a second time (the Golden Rule).
//!
//! Commands and ticks run in order on **the same** thread. No lock, no race:
//! the channel already puts them in order. Why it is like this is written at
//! the top of [`crate::state`].
//!
//! ## Why events do not go out on a timer
//!
//! D-028 measured the bridge carrying ~10,000 events per second; so this is
//! not a performance measure. The reason is this: the webview **estimates the
//! position from the anchor** (D-015), so a "still playing" message carries
//! zero information. Only what the estimate cannot know is sent — the track
//! changed, a listen was written, the store gave an error, the queue ended,
//! **or the part of the anchor that feeds the estimate changed** (state,
//! rate, duration, track identity).
//!
//! The last item was not on D-033's first list, and it silently froze the
//! interface: audio starts as `Buffering` and moves to `Playing`, and since
//! `Buffering` does not advance, the progress bar stayed at 0:00. Details in
//! [`worth_sending`].
