//! The thread that owns the core, and the way to send it work.
//!
//! **The Golden Rule:** no business logic here. This file is only a channel,
//! a constructor and an error envelope.
//!
//! ## Why its own thread and not a lock
//!
//! The measured constraint: `Session` is **`Send` but not `Sync`** — the
//! SQLite connection carries a `RefCell` — and the future `import_archive`
//! returns is not `Send` (`Box<dyn ExportArchive>` does not cross threads).
//! Tauri, on the other hand, wants every async command's future to be
//! `Send`.
//!
//! `Mutex<Core>` does not solve this: carrying the lock across an `.await`
//! needs `Core: Sync`, and `Core` is not `Sync`. The solution is to put the
//! core on a single thread: **no core type crosses the thread boundary**, only
//! job closures and serialisable results do.
//!
//! A side benefit: the tick loop lives on the same thread too, so there is
//! no lock race between commands and `tick()` — the channel puts them in
//! order.
//!
//! **The price is visible:** while a long `import` runs, the playback
//! controls wait in line too. So it does not stay silent, long commands send
//! a `headshell://busy` event (K9).
