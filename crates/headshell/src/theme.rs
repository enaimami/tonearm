//! The theme loader (PLAN §3.3, D-037/D-038).
//!
//! **Why here and not in `headshell-core`.** The Golden Rule's test is not
//! "will the GUI want this" but "can the core offer this". A theme is a CSS
//! custom property mechanism; the mobile bindings (K7) will not use CSS, and
//! the CLI's `--json` output has no theme. So this is not a core concept but
//! a shell job specific to the webview — and things of this kind are exactly
//! what should stay in the shell.
//!
//! ## The contract
//!
//! A theme is a directory with two files:
//!
//! ```text
//! <data_dir>/themes/<id>/
//!   theme.json   # { "name": ..., "author": ..., "api": 1 }
//!   theme.css    # only :root { --headshell-*: ...; }
//! ```
//!
//! The directory name **is the identity**; the `name` in the manifest is only
//! for display.
//!
//! ## Three rules, all three K9
//!
//! 1. **An `api` mismatch is not silently ignored.** The theme is rejected and
//!    the version it expects is written. "My theme does not show up" should
//!    not be a diagnostic question.
//! 2. **A theme spilling outside `:root` is not rejected, it is flagged**
//!    (D-038). The guarantee only ever holds for the tokens in `:root`; an
//!    extended theme is loaded, but labelled as such in the list.
//! 3. **A lost selection is not swallowed.** If the selected theme was
//!    deleted from disk, it goes back to the default, but says that it did
//!    ([`ActiveTheme::problem`]).
