//! The identity chain, **against the real MusicBrainz** (Phase 2 §2.3).
//!
//! `identity_accuracy.rs` measures scoring with a synthetic catalog: what is
//! tested there is the logic. What is tested here is something else — that
//! the query is really built and sent, that the response is decoded, and
//! that the chain gets tied to an **authority** without falling back to
//! `LocalKey`. Both tests are needed: one measures the rules, the other that
//! the rules are applied to the right data.
//!
//! **These tests are part of the default run** (the same decision D-043 made
//! for SoundCloud). Two failures are kept apart (K9):
//! - **Not reaching it** is not a failure: without a network the test skips
//!   itself and writes the reason to `stderr`. This is **not limited** to the
//!   TCP probe at the start — a timeout arriving in the middle of the test or
//!   an exhausted `503` retry is skipped too ([`skip_if_unreachable`],
//!   D-046). In a busy run we share the quota with the server's load at that
//!   moment too, and without this distinction a green gate would depend on
//!   the network weather.
//! - **Reaching it and getting the unexpected** fails. `400`, `404`, a parse
//!   error and an unexpected body are on this side: they may be our fault.
//!
//! When it turns red, the first question: what does `curl -A 'x/1 ( y )'
//! 'https://musicbrainz.org/ws/2/recording?query=recording:%22Creep%22&fmt=json'`
//! say? If it works, the fault is ours.
//!
//! **Rate limit.** MusicBrainz gives an anonymous client one request per
//! second. The tests share a single [`MusicBrainzLookup`] so they go through
//! the same limiter in a parallel run too — separate instances would multiply
//! the quota by the number of tests.
