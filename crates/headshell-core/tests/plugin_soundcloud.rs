//! The SoundCloud reference plugin, **against the real SoundCloud** (Phase 2
//! §2.2).
//!
//! `plugin_script.rs` tests the contract with a fixed-catalog fixture; what
//! is tested here is something else: the `soundcloud` plugin in the catalog
//! connects to a real service, and the whole chain — client_id discovery,
//! search, resolving the stream address — runs live. The plugin is not in
//! this repository: it is installed from `headshell/plugins`, from the live
//! catalog (D-071). Since D-069 the plugin runs in embedded QuickJS: it can
//! only go online to the hosts its manifest allows, and these tests are also
//! the proof that this permission is **enough** for the real service.
//!
//! **These tests are part of the default run** (D-043). A deliberate choice,
//! and it has a price: when SoundCloud is down or changes its web surface the
//! suite turns red, although nothing in our code broke. In return, the day
//! the plugin breaks is learned *that day*, not months later.
//!
//! When it turns red the first question should be: **should I look at the
//! last commit, or run `curl https://soundcloud.com/`?** If the second works
//! and the tests are still red, the fault is ours.
//!
//! Two failures are kept apart (K9):
//! - **Not reaching it** is not a test failure: without a network the test
//!   skips itself and writes the reason to `stderr` (the audio device tests'
//!   procedure).
//! - **Reaching it and getting the unexpected** fails. "I could not reach it"
//!   and "it said no" are different diagnoses with different fixes.
