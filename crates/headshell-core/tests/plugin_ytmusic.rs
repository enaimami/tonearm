//! The YouTube Music plugin, **against the real YouTube Music** (Phase 2
//! §2.5, D-048).
//!
//! The sibling of `plugin_soundcloud.rs`, and it follows the same procedure:
//! the plugin is installed into the data directory from the live catalog
//! (`headshell/plugins`, D-071) and run against the live service. What is
//! tested is not the protocol (`plugin_script.rs` tests that with a
//! fixed-catalog fixture) but **the plugin itself**: the InnerTube search,
//! the address yt-dlp resolves, and the audio really playing.
//!
//! **These tests are part of the default run** (D-043) and keep two failures
//! apart (K9):
//!
//! - **Not reaching it** is not a failure: without a network the test skips
//!   itself and writes the reason to `stderr`.
//! - **Reaching it and getting the unexpected** fails.
//!
//! Neither `python3` nor `yt-dlp` is a prerequisite: the plugin runs in
//! embedded QuickJS, and the engine downloads yt-dlp's self-contained binary
//! **for this platform** from the version pinned in the manifest (D-069).
//! Failing to download while the network is up **is not a reason to skip but
//! a reason to fail** — if the declared address is dead (orphaned), passing
//! over it silently would show a broken manifest as green.
//!
//! When it turns red, the first question: **should I look at the last commit,
//! or run `yt-dlp -J "https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=..."`?** If the second
//! works and the tests are still red, the fault is ours. If yt-dlp is out of
//! date, the fault is ours too: the manifest pins the version, not the user.
