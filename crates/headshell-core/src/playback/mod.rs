//! Playback (Phase 1).
//!
//! ## Layers
//!
//! - [`anchor`] — the single representation of state: [`PlaybackAnchor`]
//!   (D-015). The consumer computes the position from the anchor itself; the
//!   core does not shower it with notifications.
//! - [`queue`] — the queue, repeat, shuffle. A pure data structure.
//! - `engine` — symphonia (decoding) + cpal (output). **Behind the `audio`
//!   feature** (D-016): with it off the queue and the anchor still compile,
//!   only the real audio output drops out. Server and mobile builds should
//!   not be tied to ALSA.
//!
//! ## Why an anchor
//!
//! Phase 4's room sync primitive is exactly [`PlaybackAnchor`]. Today it is
//! written for local playback, tomorrow it will be broadcast over the network
//! — it is the same type from the start so we do not keep two separate state
//! models.
