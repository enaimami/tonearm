//! The audio pipeline: symphonia (decoding) + cpal (output). D-016.
//!
//! Compiled only with the `audio` feature.
//!
//! ## How it works
//!
//! Decoding happens on a background thread, which writes samples into a
//! shared ring buffer; cpal's audio callback reads from that buffer. **No
//! lock is held** between the two sides (the audio callback must not block:
//! if it blocks, the user hears crackling).
//!
//! The position is computed from the number of frames **actually handed** to
//! the output — not from the number of decoded frames. The difference is a
//! buffer's worth of time; looking at what was decoded would put the progress
//! bar ahead of the sound.
