//! Providers: where the audio comes from.
//!
//! A provider can be the local disk, a Subsonic server, SoundCloud or (from
//! Phase 2) a plugin. The core does not know which one it is; it only sees
//! the [`Provider`] trait.
//!
//! ## Why capability flags are a must
//!
//! Providers cannot all do the same things. The local disk offers search and
//! streaming but cannot be remote-controlled; Spotify (Phase 2, a separate
//! package) will be `CONTROL` only — it gives no metadata and streams no
//! audio, it only says "play this". If we assumed the trait were uniform, the
//! abstraction would collapse at the first remote player. That is why
//! capabilities are **asked at runtime**, not assumed at compile time.
//!
//! ## The `uniffi` constraint (K7)
//!
//! No generic parameters, lifetimes or closures in public signatures.
//! `Arc<dyn Provider>` can be modelled as a callback interface; async
//! functions return boxed futures like `LookupFuture` so the trait stays
//! `dyn` compatible (the same route as `MetadataLookup` in D-006).
