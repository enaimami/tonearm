//! Plugin manifest (`plugin.json`, api 2) and permission declaration
//! (D-040, D-069).
//!
//! A plugin is a directory with a `plugin.json` in it; **the directory name
//! is the identity** (the theme system's rule, D-037). The manifest's `name`
//! must match the directory name: if it does not, it is rejected — the
//! directory name is not used silently, because which name wins must not be
//! a guess (K9).
//!
//! ## api 1 → api 2
//!
//! In api 1 the manifest pointed at a **command** (`exec`), the plugin was a
//! subprocess and the permission declaration was only a contract. In api 2
//! the manifest points at a **script** (`main`), the script runs in QuickJS
//! inside the core, and the network permission is **enforced**: the plugin
//! can reach the outside world only through the gates the engine provides,
//! and the engine checks the declaration at every gate (D-069).
//!
//! Two api 1 fields lost their meaning in api 2 and are **not silently
//! ignored**: if `exec` or `permissions.fs` is seen, the manifest is
//! rejected. Ignored, an old plugin would look "loaded" and then fail
//! incomprehensibly on its first call.
