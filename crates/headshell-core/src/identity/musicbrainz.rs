//! The MusicBrainz metadata source — it feeds the 2nd and 3rd links of the K6
//! chain.
//!
//! Until this file, `MetadataLookup` had no real implementation:
//! [`OfflineLookup`](super::OfflineLookup) always said "not found" and the
//! chain dropped every record without an ISRC to `LocalKey`. So the two middle
//! links of the ISRC → **MBID** → **fuzzy** order did no measurable work
//! (D-045).
//!
//! ## The limits live here, because MusicBrainz has rules
//!
//! - **`User-Agent` is mandatory.** Requests that do not identify the
//!   application get a `403`. We produce a default value, but it can be
//!   changed with [`MusicBrainzLookup::with_user_agent`]; whoever distributes
//!   the app should put their own contact address there.
//! - **One request per second.** That is the average rate for anonymous
//!   clients; exceed it and a `503` comes back. The limiter is in
//!   [`crate::net::RateLimiter`] and **sleeps between calls**; the reasoning
//!   is written there. There is **one** limiter for the public server per
//!   process: the identity chain and the cover lookup (D-076) each hold a
//!   client, and two limiters would let two requests a second through.
